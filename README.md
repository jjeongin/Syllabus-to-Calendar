## Inspiration
Missing our own deadlines and forgetting about the quizzes and exams as we did not put down the dates in our calendars so we decided to build something that does it for us

## What it does
Reads assignment dates from pdfs and put it into a csv file that we can import in our google calendars

## How we built it
Using SUtime a nlp tool that detects the dates and difflib library of python

## What's next for ðŸ—“ ***Syllabus to calendar***
A webapp and chrome extension work on the accuracy and support multiple syllabus formats add a reminder system that reminds us of the exams and quiz regularly like 2 weeks before the actual date
